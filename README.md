# Edteam Onboarding

This Learn Curriculum is designed to help a newly hired member of the Ada Education team quickly onboard and get productive.  It should reduce the amount of time new team members take to find and get started with new resources.

Ideally a senior instructor or manager would take the new hire through the Setup checklist topic and then let the new hire review the other lessons.  Some like the online tools topic, are mostly for reference.
