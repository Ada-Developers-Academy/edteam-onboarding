# Assignments & Grading

As an instructor at Ada students are assigned the following types of assignments.

## Problemsets

Problemsets are formative assessments graded automatically by Learn and involve a variety of multiple-choice, multiple-answer, short answer and coding challenges tied directly to the day's lesson(s).  Instructors do not need to grade it, but progress should be reviewed to judge student progress.

## Coding Projects 

Ada's summative assessments projects are coding assignments involving multiple waves which build upon each other.  Students submit their repository (which runs the automated tests using Pytest) and a link to a pull request to the original repository.

Instructors typically review student code looking for:

- Areas to suggest best practices
- Reasons for test failures
- Items to praise for effectively written code.

## PSEs

PSEs are interview-like programming problems which are structured to guide students through the process of answering a technical interview problem.  Instructors review student submissions and provide feedback.
