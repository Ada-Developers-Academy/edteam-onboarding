# Capstone

Student Capstones are a 3.5 week project given at the end of the cohort.  Students, independently or in small teams develop an application from concept to deployment.  The variety and sophistication of the applications vary and depend strongly on student strengths.

Instructors guide students in developing capstone concepts and provide feedback on captone project proposals.  Once the project has begun, instructors function as project mangers helping students with prioritization and organization.
