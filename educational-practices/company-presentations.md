# Company Presentations

During the cohort, partner companies will typically meet with students for whom they may take on as an intern and present about the company, team and management.  They explain what the company/team does, roughly how it works and who the intern will be working with.  They also take and answer questions.  

This is a chance for the students to get to know the sponsoring companies and begin to develop an idea of which companies they would prefer to interview with.

It should be emphasized with students that:

1.  They have a voice in where they interview/intern, but not a vote.  Students get to express a preference, which we make some attempt to accomidate, but they cannot pick where they interview/intern.
1.  Students only get a glimpse into the companies/teams in which they will interview.  They do not get a full view.  Even companies they initially dislike, may prove to be wonderful internships.
