# Student Meetings

## Student 1-1s

Instructors are paired with a subset of their class as a 1-1 instructor for half of the cohort.  During this period the instructor will be the 1st line of contact for academic concerns and meet individually with the student once every two weeks.  Students can schedule this with [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)

## Classroom Sessions

Some student lessons will be conducted in Zoom or in person with the entire class.  

## Roundtables

Roundtable sessions meet regularly multiple times each week as small groups of students with an instructor.  In Roundtable sessions students engage in small exercises and instructors lead activities, review content and answer questions as well as conduct livecoding session. 

## Review Sessions

Periodically instructors hold optional review sessions, typically in the evenings or afternoons.  These can involve livecoding examples, Google slides, and Q&A.

Review sessions are often scheduled ad-hoc by instructors on an as-needed basis.

## Office Hours

Instructor schedule regular office hours in the calendar to provide support and Q&A with students.  Office hours usually provide support and debugging for students on projects.
