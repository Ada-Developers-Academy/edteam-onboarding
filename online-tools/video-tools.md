## Panopto

[Panopto](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/) is a service which provides lecture recording, screencasting video streaming and a website to manage the content.  We can embed panopto videos and playlists into lessons in learn with a generated embed link.

### Panopto Desktop App

Panopto also provides a [desktop app](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Cache/11.3.0.00102/Software/Panopto%20Recorder.pkg?arch=None&useCustomBinary=True) which can be used for screencasting.  

## Zoom for Video Recording

Most instructors use Zoom to record screencasts.  This can be done by recording a zoom session with screen sharing without a 3rd party in the room.  This is also a wonderful way to record a lesson as a team.

Use of recording in the public zoom rooms, for example [auditorium](https://auditorium.adadev.org) will automatically be transferred into Panopto.

## Camtasia

This is an app Chris owns and uses for recordings.  It has built-in background noise removal and provides tools for video editing, transitions, annotations, entering captions etc.  It can export to mp4 which can then be uploaded to Panopto.
