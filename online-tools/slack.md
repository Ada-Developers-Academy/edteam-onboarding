# Slack at Ada

We use Slack as our main communication and online conversation tool.  We maintain a few important slack organizations.

- **Ada Developers Academy** - The Ada internal slack used to get notices from leadership and communicate among teams at Ada.
- **Ada C16: Seattle** - The Slack organization for Ada Seattle students.
- **Ada C16: Digital** - The Slackk organization for Ada remote students.

Slack is used for daily communication and conversation.  Official communications which are documented permanently such as learning plans, newsletters, and, communications about misconduct should be sent by email.
